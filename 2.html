<p>
Dependent sheets or <a href ="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html" target = "_blank" title ="CSS specification">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>
 are the [1]languages that describe how the markup language is actually displayed,
 primarily for HTML andLTML and can also be used in XML. W3C is the standard and
  has a high degree of freedom when defining layouts and styles.

If the markup language is responsible for the body of the website, CSS is responsible
 for decorating, such as clothing and accessories. That is, changing a CSS file without
  leaving the HTML structure will make it look like a completely different website.
