    <h3>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h3>
<p>
  <a href ="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/" target ="_blank" title = "JavaScript">JavaScript (English : JavaScript)</a> is an object-based scripting language.
  This language is commonly used within Web browsers and has the ability to
  access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used for programming
  a server-side network, such as a runtime environment such as Node.js.

  The JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications
  Corporation under the name Mocha and later LiveScript, which became JavaScript.
  Although the syntax of JavaScript is similar to that of Java in Micro Systems,
  it is in fact based on the basic syntax of both languages, and Java and JavaScript
  are not directly related. Other than its name and phrase, it is more
  similar to Self-Nasskim than Java.
